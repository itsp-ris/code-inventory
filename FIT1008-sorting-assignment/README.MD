**Requirements**
1. Local variables must be stored on the runtime stack.
2. For all the MIPS programs, first implement a Python version.
3. Use only instructions on the MIPS reference sheet and use comments to document each piece of code.
4. You may copy and paste your code between tasks where you need to reuse code.
5. Create a new file/module for each task or subtask.

<br />

**Task 1**
<br /><br />Limitations:
1. Reads in a year (i.e., an integer ≥ 1582), and if the year is a leap year prints “Is a leap year”, 
otherwise prints “Is not a leap year”.
2. Include a function with the signature def is_leap_year(year) that returns true if it is a leap year 
otherwise it returns false.
3. Avoid doing any input or output in this function, instead do the input and output as part of the main function.
4. Re-write your Python program without using any user-defined functions.
5. Write a MIPS program which implements task1_4.py.

<br />

**Task 2**
<br /><br />Limitations:
1. Reads in the size of the the_list.
2. Reads in all the items – integers – into the_list.
3. Prints the range of the_list, defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum element in the list.
4. Replace any Python for loops for while loops.
5. Write a Python program the above without using any user-defined functions.
6. Write a MIPS program which implements task2_5.py.

<br />

**Task 3**
<br /><br />Limitations:
1. Write some code to find how many times a given temperature is strictly exceeded. 
<br />The user should be able to enter the list (including its size), and then the target number that 
he/she wishes to inspect.
2. Assume that the list will only contain natural numbers
